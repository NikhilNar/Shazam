# Shazam

When anyone wants to watch a movie and doesnâ€™t know what to watch, they would want to check the trailers of some trending movies around them or the top rated movies of all time. And sometimes, also rate a movie themselves. **Shazam** is an application that provides the best of both worlds. This application enables users to browse through trailers of top rated movies and trending movies, all in one place.
